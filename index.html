        <h2>Summary.</h2>
        I've always stood out by being passionate and going whole-heartedly in what I did and what I learned. In my
        early student years, I started learning iOS development using online materials and courses. Half a year after I
        joined team at <a href='http://datasite.uz' target="blank">Datasite Technologies</a> as an intern and a
        very very junior developer.
        I could work my way up and build trust among my peers and the management so that they had confidence to assign
        me to other projects. I left the company as a bird leaves its nest once its wings are strong enough. I joined a
        team at <a href='https://facebook.com/tickitco/' target="blank">tickit.co</a> where I and a team of 4 set out to
        build the first ever online ticket-selling app in Uzbekistan - <strong><em>Tickit</em></strong>. My passion for
        building outstanding user experiences helped me carve a niche for the app on <u>Apple's App Store</u> and land
        on
        <b>#7</b> in Uzbekistan's Entertainment.
        Early in 2018, friends and I started a company to build America's best Transportation Management System using
        latest web technologies and here I am, joining RS-School to expand my network of contacts and upgrade my JS
        skills to the next level.

        <h2> Skills. </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Interpersonal skills:
                I am :100: in interpersonal skills; I can find a common ground with anyone and a great team player. I
                deeply
                believe that with a great team and an absolute vision, one can achieve anything.
            </li>

            <li> Intrapersonal skills: I am deeply motivated and always go for what my heart truly believes in.</li>
